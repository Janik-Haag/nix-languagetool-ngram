# nix languagetool ngram packages

> What is this?

This is packages for all the tested and untested [ngrams](https://languagetool.org/download/ngram-data) for [languagetool](https://dev.languagetool.org/finding-errors-using-n-gram-data.html)

> Why doesn't this live in nixpkgs?

Every ngram is multiple GBs of data, cache.nixos.org already has enough trouble and this is probably nothing that a lot of people is interested in.
